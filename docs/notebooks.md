# Interactive Workshops in R and Python

**Audit Data Analysis** includes hands-on workshops that demonstrate key data science concepts through realistic audit scenarios. 
Each chapter concludes with a workshop that puts theory into practice using real-world data. 
Even better, you can run these workshops yourself—right in your browser—by clicking the one of the buttons below. 
No setup required.

- Use Binder to launch the workshops in R Markdown (RStudio interface).
- Use Google Colab to open the workshops as Python notebooks.
