# Welcome

**Audit Data Analysis** is a comprehensive introduction to audit sampling and data analytics in the context of modern auditing practice. Aimed at students, practitioners, and oversight professionals, the book provides a bridge between auditing standards—such as the ISA (International), AU (AICPA), and AS (PCAOB)—and the implementation of reproducible, data-driven procedures in real-world audit settings.

Using a blend of theoretical exposition and practical application, *Audit Data Analysis* introduces key techniques such as attribute sampling, monetary unit sampling, regression analysis, and goodness-of-fit testing (including Benford’s Law). Each method is introduced through an audit-focused case study and is followed by step-by-step guidance on statistical computations and interpretation of audit evidence.

The book emphasizes the integration of data science into audit workflows, with reproducible workshops available in both R (via R Markdown) and Python (via Jupyter Notebooks). These workshops help readers develop a practical understanding of sampling distributions, estimation, and hypothesis testing—all within the audit context.

This companion website offers downloadable datasets, annotated code examples, interactive notebooks, errata, and additional chapters. Support is provided for both RStudio users (via Binder) and Python users (via Google Colab), allowing flexible access to tools and resources for classroom use or professional development.
